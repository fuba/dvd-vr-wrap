# dvd-vr wrapper
for better filename.

## What is this script?
dvd-vr is the best tool in the world for ripping DVD-RAMs created by old-school VDRs.
But I want to use the information in VR_MANGR.IFO for filenames of ripped files.

## Usage
- Step 1: install dvd-vr https://www.pixelbeat.org/programs/dvd-vr/
- Step 2: clone this repo
- Step 3: execute as `perl [full path of dvd-vr-wrap.pl]`
